# Deep-learning-tasks

The repository includes projects covering deep learning issues. The complexity of the tasks varies and includes very different models and problems related to deep learning.

# MLP network

The simplest MLP network using the mnist dataset.

# CNN network

The simplest CNN model on the CIFAR-10.

# CIFAR-10

Develop the best possible CNN model using known techniques based on the CIFAR-10 dataset. There are three versions of the model in which new techniques are introduced to improve the obtained results. The small version is an optimal reduction of the parameters and dimensions of the model while maintaining its highest efficiency. 

# GAN_network

Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a machine learning class where two neural networks compete with each other in a game (in the form of a zero-sum game where the profit of one agent is the loss of another agent). A model generates photos similar to photos from the CIFAR-10 set. Generating a specific photo from a given photo category from cifar10: e.g. a frog, an airplane, etc.

# Image retrieval

Image retrieval systems aim to find similar images to a query image among an image dataset. CIFAR dataset was used in the task.

# Transfer learning

Transfer learning is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as a starting point for similar tasks. The task uses the Dogs vs. cats: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.

# BiT

Model with the use of Big Transfer on the basis of the car classification database. Dataset "Car Body Style Dataset" contains about 3.4 thousand photos of cars of different sizes, divided into 7 categories: https://www.kaggle.com/darshan1504/car-body-style-dataset

# LSTM

RNN model for text classification from the 20 news database. Before that, the text is pre-processed. The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network is used.

# Cartpole

Launching the CartPole model based on Deep Q-learning. The result of the work is a movie in mp4 format and gif.

# Pets facial expression classification

This dataset contains 1000 face images of various pets, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, sheep, horses, and birds. The images capture the diversity of expressions these animals can display, such as happiness, sadness, anger etc. The dataset was used to train and evaluate ResNet model that can recognize the emotions of pets from their facial expressions.
